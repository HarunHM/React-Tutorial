1. Getting started- How to set up TypeScript and React, and what are your options.

2. Components - Components are everything in React. TypeScript gives you a lot of ways how to deal with them.

3. Children - There’s nothing more beautiful than children. In React, they even can be functions.

4. Events - Apps are boring if you don’t interact with them. Clicks, inputs, etc. are handled here.

5. Prop Types- Prop Types are React’s built-in way of type checking. We can make good use of that with TypeScript.

6. Hooks - Hooks are pretty new and pretty exciting. And already pretty well typed.

7. Render props and child render props - A technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. We can type that!

8. Context - React’s context API gives you global state with a very lean API.

9. Styles: CSS in JS in lots of ways
